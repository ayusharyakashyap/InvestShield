## **üéØ Section Breakdown**

### **[00:00 - 00:30] Section 1: Introduction & Problem Statement**
**Duration: 30 seconds**

"Welcome to InvestShield, an AI-powered investment fraud detection platform.

Investment fraud costs retail investors billions annually through WhatsApp groups, fake websites, and social media scams. Traditional fraud detection is reactive and slow.

InvestShield provides real-time protection through AI analysis and regulatory compliance verification."

### **[00:30 - 02:30] Section 2: Live Solution Demonstration**
**Duration: 2 minutes**

"Let me demonstrate InvestShield's three core modules.

**Content Scanner:**
Safe content: 'SEBI has updated investment guidelines for mutual funds. Please review the official circular on our website.' This returns a low risk score of 15% - clearly legitimate regulatory information.

Medium risk content: 'Act fast! Our investment plan offers above-average returns and is filling up quickly. While returns are not guaranteed, many clients have seen great results. Contact us soon to reserve your spot.' This shows 50.8% risk due to promotional language but lacks extreme fraud indicators.

High risk: 'Guaranteed 100% returns in 30 days! Join our WhatsApp group for insider SEBI tips! Limited slots available!' This returns 94.8% fraud probability, flagging keywords like 'guaranteed returns', 'insider tips', and 'urgent action'.

URL analysis: sebi.gov.in shows safe, while househippofoundation.org shows medium risk.

**Advisor Verification:**
INA00001240 - verified advisor with full credentials.
INA000001242 - unverified with fraud warnings.
INA00000999 - not found, potential fraud.
Search 'Rohit Agarwal' - specific matches.
Search 'Sharma' - lists all advisors with that surname.

**Live Dashboard:**
Real-time fraud monitoring with auto-updates. View Details and Download buttons for reports. Filtering by date, platform, and risk level. Shows fraud trends and emerging patterns."
